# Assignment 7, dynamic programming

## Building and using

- Build with `make`
- Run with ./longtrip

In `longtrip.c` you can change `nhotels` to run the generated large test case for another amount of nodes.
Default is 25000 nodes.
You can also try the simple test cases by uncommenting the appropriate sections.
